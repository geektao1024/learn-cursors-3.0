```

#### Best Practices Consultation

```

```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Context Management

1. **Automatic Context**

   - Current file content
   - Project structure information
   - Related dependencies

2. **Manual Context**

   - Select code snippets
   - Reference other files
   - Add project information

3. **Context Control**
   - Clear context
   - Update context
   - View current context

### 2. Multi-mode Interaction

1. **Q&A Mode**

```
Q: What's the difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect in React?
A: The main differences between these two Hooks are in their timing:

1. useEffect
- Executes asynchronously
- Triggers after rendering
- Doesn't block browser rendering
- Suitable for most side effects

2. useLayoutEffect
- Executes synchronously
- Triggers immediately after DOM changes
- Blocks browser rendering
- Suitable for DOM measurement operations
```

2. **Code Analysis Mode**

```typescript
// Please analyze the performance issues in this component
function ExpensiveList({ items }) {
  const processedItems = items.map(item => {
    // Complex processing logic
    return heavyProcessing(item)
  })

  return (
    <ul>
      {processedItems.map(item => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

// Analysis:
// 1. Reprocesses data on every render
// 2. Lacks memoization optimization
// 3. May cause unnecessary re-renders

// Optimization suggestion:
function OptimizedList({ items }) {
  const processedItems = useMemo(() =>
    items.map(item => heavyProcessing(item)),
    [items]
  )

  return (
    <ul>
      {processedItems.map(item => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

3. **Tutorial Mode**

````
Let's implement a custom Hook step by step:

1. First, define the basic structure of the Hook:
```typescript
function useDebounce<T>(value: T, delay: number): T {
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value)

  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(value)
    }, delay)

    return () => {
      clearTimeout(timer)
    }
  }, [value, delay])

  return debouncedValue
}
````
