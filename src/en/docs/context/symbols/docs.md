# Cursor - Build Software Faster

### `@Docs`

Cursor provides a set of third-party documentation that has been crawled, indexed, and prepared for use as context. You can access them using the `@Docs` symbol.

### Adding Custom Documentation

If you want to crawl and index custom documentation that isn't already provided, you can do so through `@Docs` > `Add New Documentation`.
After pasting the URL of the desired documentation, the following modal will appear:

![@docs-add](https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/context/@docs-add.png)

Afterward, Cursor will index and learn the documentation, and you'll be able to use it as context just like any other documentation.

### Managing Custom Documentation

Under `Cursor Settings` > `Features` > `Documentation`, you'll see the documentation you've added.
You can edit, delete, or add new documentation here.

![@docs-manage](https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/context/@docs-manage.png)
