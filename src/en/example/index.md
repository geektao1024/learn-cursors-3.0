      <p>As a developer who frequently reads technical articles, I often wanted to find a convenient tool to extract and save article highlights.
      This led to the idea of developing a browser plugin, which quickly became a reality with the help of AI.</p>

Unfortunately, after working with Cursor for over a month without success, this company managed to create it. /(ã„’oã„’)/~~ </p>
