# Cursor - Build Software Faster

### Pasting Links

To have Cursor access links before responding, type `@` and then paste the link.

![@link](https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/context/@link.png)

### Removing Links

By default, we automatically parse links and convert them to `@Links` in Cursor chat.
If you want links to appear as plain text, click on the link and then click "Unlink".

![@link-unlink](https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/context/@link-unlink.png)

- `@https://your-link.com`
