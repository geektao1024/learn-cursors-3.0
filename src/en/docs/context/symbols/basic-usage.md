### Basic @ Symbol Usage

In Cursor's AI input fields, such as in Cmd K, chat, or terminal Cmd K, you can use @ symbols by typing `@`. A popup menu will appear, listing a series of suggestions that will automatically filter based on your input to show only the most relevant suggestions.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

You can navigate through the suggestion list using the up and down arrow keys. You can press `Enter` to select a suggestion. If the suggestion is a category, such as `Files`, the suggestions will be filtered to show only the most relevant items within that category.
