# Cursor - Build Software Faster

### Default Codebase Chat

If the codebase is not indexed, Cursor Chat will first try to compute some search queries to search within the codebase. For improved accuracy, embedding search is recommended.

### Embedding Search

With codebase indexing, Cursor Chat can generate responses accurately based on your codebase.

After entering a message, press `Ctrl/âŒ˜ + Enter`, and Cursor Chat will scan your indexed codebase for relevant code snippets. This is typically useful for quickly including code snippets to incorporate into the conversation's context. For better control over codebase search and higher accuracy, you can use `@codebase`.

### Advanced Codebase Search

When using `@Codebase`, Cursor codebase chat performs a more detailed search.
