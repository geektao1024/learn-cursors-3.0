### `@Code`

To reference specific sections of code, you can use the `@Code` symbol.

### Code Preview

Similar to the `@Files` symbol, Cursor will show a preview of the code content so you can verify that you're referencing the correct code.

### Adding from Editor

Another way to add code snippets as context is to select the code you want to reference, then click "Add to Chat" (`Ctrl/⌘ Shift L`) or "Add to Edit" (`Ctrl/⌘ Shift K`).

These actions will add the selected code snippet to the chat input box or the currently active Cmd K prompt bar.

To add the selected code to a new chat, you can press `Ctrl/⌘ L`.
