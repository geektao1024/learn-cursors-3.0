### Shadow Workspace

Shadow workspace is an optional setting that you can configure to improve the quality of AI-generated code. Only certain features use it.

If you enable shadow workspace, the background AI can request lints for the code they write. This creates a hidden window on your local machine to ensure your coding experience remains unaffected.

Shadow workspace will increase Cursor's memory usage, so we recommend enabling this feature only if you have plenty of RAM.
