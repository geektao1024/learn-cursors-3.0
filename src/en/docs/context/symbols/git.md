Currently, `@Git` is only supported in Cursor chat.

### `@Git`

In Cursor's chat, you can use `@Git` to add Git commits, diffs, or pull requests to your prompt.

### Common Use Cases

A common use case for `@Git` is to allow Cursor's AI to scan diffs and look for potential errors or issues that might be caused by the diff.

You can also use `@Diff of Working State` to generate commit messages from your current diff.
