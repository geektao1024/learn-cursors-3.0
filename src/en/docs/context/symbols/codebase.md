# Cursor - Build Software Faster

### `@Codebase`

With `@Codebase`, Cursor chat goes through the following steps until it finds the most important code snippets to use.

- **Collect**: Scan your codebase for important files/code blocks
- **Rerank**: Reorder context items based on relevance to the query
- **Reason**: Think through a plan for using the context
- **Generate**: Propose a response

Another way to submit advanced codebase queries is to click the dropdown menu next to the `Ctrl/âŒ˜ + Enter` button and select `reranker` as the search behavior.
This is only available when not using `@Codebase`, otherwise `@Codebase` takes precedence.
