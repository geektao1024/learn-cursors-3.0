### Premium Models

GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet all count as `premium` models.

### Pro Trial

All new users get a 14-day pro trial with access to all pro features. After the 14-day trial period, users who haven't upgraded will revert to the hobby plan.

### Fast and Slow Requests

By default, Cursor servers attempt to provide fast `premium` model requests for all users. However, during peak times,
users who have used up their fast `premium` credits will be moved to the slow pool, which is essentially a queue of users waiting for fast `premium` requests to become available.

This queue is fair, and Cursor will do everything possible to keep the queue as short as possible.
However, if you need more fast `premium` credits and don't want to wait, you can add more requests on the settings page.

### Checking Your Usage

You can check your usage on the Cursor settings page. You can also access this within the Cursor application,
under `Cursor Settings` > `General` > `Account`, by clicking "Manage Subscription" for Pro users or "Manage" for Business users.

Cursor usage resets monthly, based on your subscription start date.

### Optional Usage-Based Pricing

You can opt into usage-based pricing for requests beyond what's included in your plan by visiting your settings page.

Usage-based pricing details:

- Usage-based pricing is billed by calendar month (not necessarily aligned with your billing cycle, roughly billed on the 2-3rd of each month)
- We don't count usage if you cancel the request immediately or if the request errors
- You can configure a hard limit that you'll never pay more than per month (for usage-based pricing)
- Currently, usage-based pricing is only available for Claude 3 Opus and some long-text chat models
- Currently, usage-based pricing only applies to `premium` models
