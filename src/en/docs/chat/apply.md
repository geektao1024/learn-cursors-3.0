# Cursor - Build Software Faster

### Applying Code Blocks

Cursor's `Apply` feature allows you to quickly integrate code block suggestions from chat into your code.

To apply a code block suggestion, you can click the play button in the top right corner of each chat code block.

This will edit your file to incorporate the code generated by Chat. Since you can add the most context and have the most back-and-forth with the model in chat,
we recommend using Chat + Apply for more complex AI-driven code changes.

### Accept or Reject

Once you've applied a code block, you can review the diff and accept or reject the changes. You can also click the "Accept" or "Reject" buttons in the top right corner of the chat code block.

Press `Ctrl/⌘ Enter` to accept, press `Ctrl/⌘ Backspace` to reject.
