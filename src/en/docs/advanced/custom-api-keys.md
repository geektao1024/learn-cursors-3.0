# Cursor - Build Software Faster

### OpenAI API Keys

Cursor allows you to input your own OpenAI API key to send unlimited AI messages at your own cost.

You can get your own API key from [here](https://www.openai.com/api-keys). To use your own API key, go to `Cursor Settings` > `Models` > `OpenAI API Key` and enter your API key. Then, click the "Verify" button. Once your key is verified, your OpenAI API key will be enabled.
