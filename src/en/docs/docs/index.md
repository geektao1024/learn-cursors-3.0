Cursor is a fork of VS Code. This allows us to focus on providing the best AI coding experience while maintaining a familiar text editing experience.

### Import Extensions, Themes, Settings, and Keyboard Bindings

You can import your VS Code configuration into Cursor with one click. Navigate to `Cursor Settings` > `General` > `Account`.

### Stay Up to Date

We regularly update Cursor based on the latest version of VS Code.

### Why Not an Extension?

As a standalone application, Cursor has more control over the editor's UI, enabling deeper AI integration. Some of our features, like Cursor tabs and CMD-K, would not be possible as plugins for existing coding environments.

### Settings

You can open Cursor-specific settings panel by clicking the gear button in the top right, pressing `Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + J`, or using `Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + P` and typing `Cursor Settings`.

You can access VS Code-specific settings by using `Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + P` and typing `VS Code Settings`.

### Why is the Activity Bar Horizontal in Cursor?

The activity bar is horizontal by default to save space for chat. If you prefer the traditional vertical activity bar, you can set `workbench.activityBar.orientation` to `vertical` in VS Code settings and restart Cursor.
