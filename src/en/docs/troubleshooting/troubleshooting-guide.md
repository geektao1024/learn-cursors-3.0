Here's a list of information that's useful in most Cursor troubleshooting scenarios:

**01)** Screenshot of the issue (with any sensitive information removed)

**02)** Steps to reproduce

**03)** System information from:

`Cursor` > `Help` > `About`

**04)** Are you using a VPN or Zscaler?

**05)** Developer Tools Console Errors

Open Developer Tools by:

`Cursor` > `Help` > `Toggle Developer Tools`

Then click `Console` to see if there are any relevant errors.

**06)** Logs

On Windows, you can find logs here:

C:\Users\AppData\Roaming\Cursor\logs

This is the parent folder of the folder that opens when you:

- Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` (to open Command Palette in Cursor)

- Type and select `Developer: Open Logs Folder`

You can also view logs in `Cursor` > `Terminal` > `Output`, then click the dropdown and select `Window` or other Cursor-specific options like `Cursor Tab` or `Cursor Indexing and Retrieval`.
