# Cursor - Build Software Faster

### Index Your Codebase

To get more accurate and better codebase answers using `@codebase` or `Ctrl/âŒ˜ Enter`, you can index your codebase. In the background, Cursor computes embedding vectors for each file in your codebase and uses these vectors to improve the accuracy of your codebase answers.

Your codebase index will automatically stay in sync with your latest codebase changes.

You can view your codebase indexing status under `Cursor Settings` > `Features` > `Codebase Indexing`.

### Advanced Settings

By default, Cursor will index all files in your codebase.

You can also expand the `Show Settings` section to access more advanced options.
Here, you can decide whether to enable automatic indexing for new repositories and configure which files Cursor will ignore during repository indexing, in addition to your .gitignore settings.

If you have any large content files in your project that AI absolutely doesn't need to read, ignoring these files might improve the accuracy of answers.
