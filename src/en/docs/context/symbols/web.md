## `@Web`

With `@Web`, Cursor builds search queries based on your provided query and context, and searches the web for relevant information as additional context. This is particularly useful for finding the latest information.

### Always On

You can have Cursor search the web every time you query chat by enabling "Always Search Web" under `Cursor Settings` > `Features` > `Chat`. This is equivalent to using `@Web` in every query.

- `@Web`
